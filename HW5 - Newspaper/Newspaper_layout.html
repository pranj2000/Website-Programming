			<h3>Dragon sleeps in Mt.Fuji</h3>
				<p>
				Dragons are mythological creatures that have existed in folklore of cultures all over the world for thousands of years. In Western culture, the imaginary creature is typically described as a giant four-legged reptile covered in scales that is able to breathe fire and able to fly with powerful bat-like wings.	

				Japan’s Mt. Fuji is an active volcano about 100 kilometers southwest of Tokyo. Commonly called “Fuji-san,” it’s the country’s tallest peak, at 3,776 meters. A pilgrimage site for centuries, it’s considered one of Japan’s 3 sacred mountains, and summit hikes remain a popular activity. Its iconic profile is the subject of numerous works of art, notably Edo Period prints by Hokusai and Hiroshige

			<h3>Falling stars spotted in Dallas</h3>
				<p>
				Just seeing one is considered to be good luck. Some cultures believe that fallen souls believe that shooting stars represent souls that have been released from purgatory, allowing them to finally go up to heaven and be at peace. In other cultures, a shooting star is the soul of a new baby coming to Earth to be born.
				
				Some shooting star superstitions can affect your life without any action on your part, but the type of luck you end up with could depend on something as random as where the star is positioned in the sky. If you spot a fallen star on your right, it means good luck, while one on your left indicates misfortune will follow. If you're quick, you may be able to shift position as the star travels in an attempt to change your luck.

				It's well established that attempting to count the stars can be unlucky or even fatal, but one superstition holds that it's OK to count under very specific circumstances. According to folklore, only an unmarried person looking for love can keep a tally. Even in this case, the unmarried person can count a maximum of seven stars on seven consecutive nights. If you do this, the first person of your preferred sex that you shake hands with on the eighth day is the one you'll marry.

			<h3>New creature discovered in the Amazon</h3>
				<p>	
				The Amazon River Basin is home to the largest rainforest on Earth. The basin -- roughly the size of the forty-eight contiguous United States -- covers some 40 percent of the South American continent and includes parts of eight South American countries: Brazil, Bolivia, Peru, Ecuador, Colombia, Venezuela, Guyana, and Suriname, as well as French Guiana, a department of France.

				Reflecting environmental conditions as well as past human influence, the Amazon is made up of a mosaic of ecosystems and vegetation types including rainforests, seasonal forests, deciduous forests, flooded forests, and savannas.

				The basin is drained by the Amazon River, the world's largest river in terms of discharge, and the second longest river in the world after the Nile. The river is made up of over 1,100 tributaries, 17 of which are longer than 1000 miles, and two of which (the Negro and the Madeira) are larger, in terms of volume, than the Congo river.
				
				Goddesses of forests, dryads hold strong power over plants, particularly trees and wood. Dryads can make plants grow within seconds and can change a seed into a towering oak. Wood Manipulation: Dryads can call on the energy within wood, even that of dead wood.
